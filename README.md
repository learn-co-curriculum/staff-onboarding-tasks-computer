# Things to do on your computer (~30-45 minutes)

- **Finish your Justworks enrollment.** If you haven't finished tax, payroll, and benefits onboarding on Justworks, do it now! Ask Sarah Fox if you have any questions.



- **Use a password manager.** Password managers make your life more secure and easier. If you're not already using one, you should start. There are several [free options](http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2475964,00.asp); there is no company standard.


- **Set up 2-step authentication for Google Apps.** If you are not already familiar with 2-step authentication, please [read about it](https://www.google.com/landing/2step/), else you can jump right to [setup](https://accounts.google.com/SmsAuthConfig). If you have any questions, please email/chat JM Imbrescia (Director of Engineering - Operations and Infrastructure) to introduce yourself and to get your questions answered.


- **Review your [calendar](https://www.google.com/calendar).** You already have meeting invites - don't miss a meeting on your first day!


- **Set up Slack (chat app).** Sign up for a [staff Slack account](https://flatiron-staff.slack.com/signup). If you are an instructor, you should also sign up for a [student Slack account](http://flatiron-school.slack.com/signup) in order to chat with your students. You should definitely download the desktop app from the Mac App Store, and you can also download a mobile version as well. There is also a [wiki guide to using Slack](https://flatiron.atlassian.net/wiki/display/ER/Common+tools).


- **Sign up for Learn!** You're already on the Staff Onboarding track on Learn! However, there are many other tracks of content that you can go through to learn how to code. Introduce yourself to Adam Jonas (Managing Director of Labs) to get set up. You can work through the content on your own time, and use the ask a question feature to get help at any time :)
