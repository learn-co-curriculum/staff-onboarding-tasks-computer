# Things to do on your computer

- **Finish your Justworks enrollment.** If you haven't finished tax, payroll, and benefits onboarding on Justworks, do it now. Finance needs a copy of your passport or combination of applicable documents as soon as possible. Additionally, within the first month you'll want to decide whether to accept or decline health insurance. JustWorks is filled with important and helpful information like a staff calendar, employee directory, and place to request time off - take it for a spin!


- **Review your [calendar](https://www.google.com/calendar).** In a new employee's first week, we set you up with a variety of lunches and coffees to get you meeting other members of the team. Undoubtedly, you already have other meeting invites too, so check them out!


- **Set up Slack (chat app).** You may have already done this during your onboarding session, but be sure you have set up your Slack. You will have invites in your GMail for any Slack teams you need access to already. You should definitely download the desktop app as well and you can do so by searching for the direct download version for Mac. There is also a [wiki guide to using Slack](https://flatiron.atlassian.net/wiki/display/ER/Common+tools).


- **Additional Learn Tracks.** You're already here, so you're signed up for Learn. You've made your account and connected with Github. As you can imagine, are many other tracks of content that you can go through, or may need in your role. Be sure to ask your manager what you might need access to. Once you've done that introduce yourself to Adam Jonas (Director of Engineering) to get set up with any other tracks your need.


- **Use a password manager.** Password managers make your life more secure and easier. If you're not already using one, you should start. There are several [free options](http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2475964,00.asp); there is no company standard.


- **Set up 2-step authentication for Google Apps.** If you are not already familiar with 2-step authentication, please [read about it](https://www.google.com/landing/2step/), else you can jump right to [setup](https://accounts.google.com/SmsAuthConfig).
